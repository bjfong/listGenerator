# listGenerator

This repository contains a random method that I decided to do on a whim.

This little program generates a list based on the inputs passed in. If you pass in a list of words, this program creates a string containing those words and also takes into account if you want to pass an Oxford comma. 

For example, if you have a list of strings "Hello", "Hi", and "Hola" and you want to use an Oxford comma, the final result would be "Hello, Hi, and Hola". If you decide not to use the Oxford comma, then the final result would be "Hello, Hi and Hola".
